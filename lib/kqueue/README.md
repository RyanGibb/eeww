# Kqueue

Low level OCaml bindings for [kqueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue).

### Documentation

Kqueue-ml's api is a minimal wrapper around kqueue so it is recommended to consult with kqueue manpages for freebsd, openbsd, netbsd, macOS for reference.

**Caveat**: This is mostly tested on macOS. Please open issues for any problems noticed on other BSD systems.
